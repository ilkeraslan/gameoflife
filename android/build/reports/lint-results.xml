        id="ObsoleteLintCustomCheck"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Lint found an issue registry (`androidx.appcompat.AppCompatIssueRegistry`) which is older than the current API level; these checks may not work correctly.&#xA;&#xA;Recompile the checks against the latest version. Custom check API version is 7 (4.0), current lint API level is 8 (4.1)"

        priority="10"
        summary="Obsolete custom lint check"
        explanation="Lint can be extended with &quot;custom checks&quot;: additional checks implemented by developers and libraries to for example enforce specific API usages required by a library or a company coding style guideline.&#xA;&#xA;The Lint APIs are not yet stable, so these checks may either cause a performance degradation, or stop working, or provide wrong results.&#xA;&#xA;This warning flags custom lint checks that are found to be using obsolete APIs and will need to be updated to run in the current lint environment.&#xA;&#xA;It may also flag issues found to be using a **newer** version of the API, meaning that you need to use a newer version of lint (or Android Studio or Gradle plugin etc) to work with these checks."
